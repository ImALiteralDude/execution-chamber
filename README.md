Kill GIR from Invader Zim at the push of a button!


I have made a small little shitty HTML thing that allows you to murder GIR from Invader Zim via the push of a single button. I did this because I had nothing better to do.

it adjusts to screen size, yippee!

Instructions:

1. unzip the zip file
2. install irken font (optional, but i didn't set a fallback font so have fun with times new roman
3. open the html file
4. profit
